To date, 1852 chemical structures have been identified with a molecular weight less than 2000 of which 492 are or have active metabolites. To promote the sharing of data, the original web server was upgraded for browsing the database and downloading the data sets (http://chemoinfo.ipmc.cnrs.fr/edrug3d). It is believed that the multidimensional chemistry-oriented collections are an essential resource for a thorough analysis of the current drug chemical space. The data sets are envisioned as being used in a wide range of endeavors that include drug repurposing, drug design, privileged structures analyses, structure-activity relationship studies, and improving of absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination predictive models.},

  abstract = {Interleukin-3 (IL-3) is a cytokine belonging to the family of common β (βc) and is involved in various biological systems. Its activity is mediated by the interaction with its receptor (IL-3R), a heterodimer composed of two distinct subunits: IL-3Rα and βc. IL-3 and its receptor, especially IL-3Rα, play a crucial role in pathologies like inflammatory diseases and therefore are interesting therapeutic targets. Here, we have performed an analysis of these proteins and their interaction based on structural and evolutionary information. We highlighted that IL-3 and IL-3Rα structural architectures are conserved across evolution and shared with other proteins belonging to the same βc family interleukin-5 (IL-5) and granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). The IL-3Rα/IL-3 interaction is mediated by a large interface in which most residues are surprisingly not conserved during evolution and across family members. In spite of this high variability, we suggested small regions constituted by few residues conserved during the evolution in both proteins that could be important for the binding affinity.},

  abstract = {The Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) contains a complete record of all published organic and metal–organic small-molecule crystal structures. The database has been in operation for over 50\hspace{0.25em}years and continues to be the primary means of sharing structural chemistry data and knowledge across disciplines. As well as structures that are made public to support scientific articles, it includes many structures published directly as CSD Communications. All structures are processed both computationally and by expert structural chemistry editors prior to entering the database. A key component of this processing is the reliable association of the chemical identity of the structure studied with the experimental data. This important step helps ensure that data is widely discoverable and readily reusable. Content is further enriched through selective inclusion of additional experimental data. Entries are available to anyone through free CSD community web services. Linking services developed and maintained by the CCDC, combined with the use of standard identifiers, facilitate discovery from other resources. Data can also be accessed through CCDC and third party software applications and through an application programming interface.},

  abstract = {The gene IL-3 encodes interleukin 3, a hematopoietic colony-stimulating factor (CSF) that is capable of supporting the proliferation of a broad range of hematopoietic cell types. By using somatic cell hybrids and in situ chromosomal hybridization, we localized this gene to human chromosome 5 at bands q23-31, a chromosomal region that is frequently deleted [del(5q)] in patients with myeloid disorders. By in situ hybridization, IL-3 was found to be deleted in the 5q-chromosome of one patient with refractory anemia who had a del(5)(q15q33.3), of three patients with refractory anemia (two patients) or acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL) de novo who had a similar distal breakpoint [del(5)(q13q33.3)], and of a fifth patient, with therapy-related ANLL, who had a similar distal breakpoint in band q33 [del(5)(q14q33.3)]. Southern blot analysis of somatic cell hybrids retaining the normal or the deleted chromosome 5 from two patients with the refractory anemia 5q- syndrome indicated that IL-3 sequences were absent form the hybrids retaining the deleted chromosome 5 but not from hybrids that had a cytologically normal chromosome 5. Thus, a small segment of chromosome 5 contains IL-3, GM-CSF (the gene encoding granulocyte-macrophage-CSF), CSF-1 (the gene encoding macrophage-CSF), and FMS (the human c-fms protooncogene, which encodes the CSF-1 receptor). Our findings and earlier results indicating that GM-CSF, CSF-1, and FMS were deleted in the 5q-chromosome, suggest that loss of IL-3 or of other CSF genes may play an important role in the pathogenesis of hematologic disorders associated with a del(5q).},

  abstract = {▪ Abstract\hspace{0.6em} Comparative modeling predicts the three-dimensional structure of a given protein sequence (target) based primarily on its alignment to one or more proteins of known structure (templates). The prediction process consists of fold assignment, target–template alignment, model building, and model evaluation. The number of protein sequences that can be modeled and the accuracy of the predictions are increasing steadily because of the growth in the number of known protein structures and because of the improvements in the modeling software. Further advances are necessary in recognizing weak sequence–structure similarities, aligning sequences with structures, modeling of rigid body shifts, distortions, loops and side chains, as well as detecting errors in a model. Despite these problems, it is currently possible to model with useful accuracy significant parts of approximately one third of all known protein sequences. The use of individual comparative models in biology is already rewarding and increasingly widespread. A major new challenge for comparative modeling is the integration of it with the torrents of data from genome sequencing projects as well as from functional and structural genomics. In particular, there is a need to develop an automated, rapid, robust, sensitive, and accurate comparative modeling pipeline applicable to whole genomes. Such large-scale modeling is likely to encourage new kinds of applications for the many resulting models, based on their large number and completeness at the level of the family, organism, or functional network.},

  abstract = {Autoimmune disorder is a chronic immune imbalance which is developed through a series of pathways. The defect in B cells, T cells, and lack of self-tolerance has been greatly associated with the onset of many types of autoimmune complications including rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), multiple sclerosis, and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy. The SLE is an autoimmune disease with a common type of lupus that causes tissue and organ damage due to the wide spread of inflammation. In the current study, twenty anti-inflammatory peptides derived from plant and animal sources were docked as ligands or peptides counter to proinflammatory cytokines. Interferon gamma (IFN-γ), interleukin 3 (IL-3), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) were targeted in this study as these are involved in the pathogenesis of SLE in many clinical studies. Two docking approaches (i.e., protein-ligand docking and peptide-protein docking) were employed in this study using Molecular Operating Environment (MOE) software and HADDOCK web server, respectively. Amongst docked twenty peptides, the peptide DEDTQAMMPFR with                                                   S                                               -score of -11.3018 and HADDOCK score of                                                   −                   10.3                   ±                   2.5                                               \,kcal/mol showed the best binding interactions and energy validation with active amino acids of IFN-γ protein in both docking approaches. Depending upon these results, this peptide could be used as a potential drug candidate to target IFN-γ, IL-3, and TNF-α proteins to control inflammatory events. Other peptides (i.e., QEPQESQQ and FRDEHKK) also revealed good binding affinity with IFN-γ with                                                   S                                               -scores of -10.98 and -10.55, respectively. Similarly, the peptides KHDRGDEF, FRDEHKK, and QEPQESQQ showed best binding interactions with IL-3 with                                                   S                                               -scores of -8.81, -8.64, and -8.17, respectively.},

  abstract = {Background: A frequent problem in computational modeling is the interconversion of chemical structures between different formats. While standard interchange formats exist (for example, Chemical Markup Language) and de facto standards have arisen (for example, SMILES format), the need to interconvert formats is a continuing problem due to the multitude of different application areas for chemistry data, differences in the data stored by different formats (0D versus 3D, for example), and competition between software along with a lack of vendorneutral formats. Results: We discuss, for the first time, Open Babel, an open-source chemical toolbox that speaks the many languages of chemical data. Open Babel version 2.3 interconverts over 110 formats. The need to represent such a wide variety of chemical and molecular data requires a library that implements a wide range of cheminformatics algorithms, from partial charge assignment and aromaticity detection, to bond order perception and canonicalization. We detail the implementation of Open Babel, describe key advances in the 2.3 release, and outline a variety of uses both in terms of software products and scientific research, including applications far beyond simple format interconversion. Conclusions: Open Babel presents a solution to the proliferation of multiple chemical file formats. In addition, it provides a variety of useful utilities from conformer searching and 2D depiction, to filtering, batch conversion, and substructure and similarity searching. For developers, it can be used as a programming library to handle chemical data in areas such as organic chemistry, drug design, materials science, and computational chemistry.

Among the 15 previously treated patients, the response rate was 67\%, and the median overall survival was 8.5 months. The most common adverse events were increased levels of alanine aminotransferase (64\%) and aspartate aminotransferase (60\%), hypoalbuminemia (55\%), peripheral edema (51\%), and thrombocytopenia (49\%). Capillary leak syndrome was reported in 19\% of the patients and was associated with one death in each of the dose subgroups. CONCLUSIONS In adult patients with untreated or relapsed BPDCN, the use of tagraxofusp led to clinical responses. Serious adverse events included capillary leak syndrome; hepatic dysfunction and thrombocytopenia were common.

  abstract = {Abstract             The alpha subunit of the human interleukin-3 receptor (IL-3R alpha) is a 70-kD glycoprotein member of the hematopoietin receptor superfamily. This protein associates with a beta subunit common to the receptors for IL-5 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) to form a high-affinity receptor for IL-3. To identify regions of IL-3R alpha critical for ligand binding and receptor function, cDNAs encoding mutant receptors were generated and expressed in COS cells along with the beta subunit. Mutant receptors lacking almost the entire cytoplasmic domain of IL-3R alpha [IL-3R alpha(CD)] or carrying a substitution of trp for leu in the membrane proximal leu-ser-x-trp-ser (LSXWS) box bound 125I-IL-3 with nearly the same affinity as wild-type IL-3R alpha. In contrast, a mutant lacking the entire “LSXWS” motif failed to bind 125I-IL-3 with high affinity despite showing surface expression. In addition, hybrid receptors composed of the first 104 amino acids (aa) of IL-3R alpha joined to aa 118 through 400 of the alpha subunit of the GM-CSF receptor (GM-R alpha) [IL-3R alpha/GM-R alpha] or the first 118 aa of GM-R alpha joined to aa 104 through 378 of IL-3R alpha [GM-R alpha/IL-3R alpha] failed to bind 125I-IL-3 in the presence of the beta subunit. A third hybrid receptor composed of the first 281 residues of IL-3R alpha fused to residues 306 through 379 of GM-R alpha [IL-3R alpha/GM-R alpha-DS] also failed to bind 125I-IL-3 in the presence of the beta subunit but, in contrast to the IL-3R alpha/GM- R alpha hybrid, demonstrated weak surface expression. Mutant receptors lacking the N-terminal 30 aa and the N-terminal 9 aa also did not bind 125I-IL-3 with high affinity, although both were expressed on the cell surface. These data suggest that although the cytoplasmic domain and the leucine residue of the “LSXWS” box are not critical for ligand binding or beta-subunit association, the “LSXWS” motif and amino-terminal sequences are important for these functions.},

  abstract = {Mouse mast cells were differentiated and grown by culturing bone marrow cells in medium containing 2 X 10(-10) M purified interleukin 3 (IL 3). The cells obtained were similar in ultrastructure, membrane antigen phenotype, proteoglycan type, and lipid products generated upon immunologic activation to mast cells differentiated in culture by WEHI-3-conditioned medium (WEHI-3-CM) and by concanavalin A (Con A) splenocyte-conditioned medium. Phenotypically, these cells expressed IgE receptors and H-2 antigens and were recognized by a monoclonal antibody (B23.1) that did not react with mouse serosal heparin-containing mast cells. The classic phenotypic markers of mouse T cells or macrophages were not detected. The mouse mast cells differentiated with IL 3 as well as those differentiated in WEHI-3-CM incorporated [35S]sulfate into a nonheparin proteoglycan of 150,000 to 200,000 m.w. Most of the 35S-labeled macromolecules were degraded by chondroitinase ABC to yield only two disaccharides, which co-chromatographed on ascending thin layer chromatography with delta Di-4S and delta Di-diSE; thus, the proteoglycan in these cells is composed of chondroitin sulfate E glycosaminoglycans. After sensitization with monoclonal IgE, washing, and antigen activation, the IL 3 differentiated cells released the preformed mediator beta-hexosaminidase and generated and released two major classes of lipid mediators. The quantities of leukotriene C4 (LTC4), leukotriene B4 (LTB4), and platelet-activating factor (PAF-acether) generated/10(6) cells were 17, 3.0, and 3.1 ng, respectively. The ratio of these three lipid mediators was similar to that obtained from mast cells differentiated in WEHI-3-CM and in Con A-conditioned medium. Thus, T cell-derived IL 3 is the component present in the conditioned media that is required for differentiation and growth of the subclass of mast cells containing chondroitin sulfate E proteoglycan, designated E-MC. The IL 3-dependent E-MC may represent the in vitro counterpart of the T-cell-dependent mucosal mast cell, suggesting in turn that the production of LTC4 and LTB4 and of PAF-acether may play a role in adaptive intestinal immunity to helminthic parasites.}

  abstract = {Cytokines are important in adult hematopoiesis, yet their function in embryonic hematopoiesis has been largely unexplored. During development, hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are found in the aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM) region, yolk sac (YS), and placenta and require the Runx1 transcription factor for their normal generation. Since IL-3 is a Runx1 target and this cytokine acts on adult hematopoietic cells, we examined whether IL-3 affects HSCs in the mouse embryo. Using Runx1 haploinsufficient mice, we show that IL-3 amplifies HSCs from E11 AGM, YS, and placenta. Moreover, we show that IL-3 mutant embryos are deficient in HSCs and that IL-3 reveals the presence of HSCs in the AGM and YS prior to the stage at which HSCs are normally detected. Thus, our studies support an unexpected role for IL-3 during development and strongly suggest that IL-3 functions as a proliferation and/or survival factor for the earliest HSCs in the embryo.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The aim of the UniProt Knowledgebase is to provide users with a comprehensive, high-quality and freely accessible set of protein sequences annotated with functional information. In this article, we describe significant updates that we have made over the last two years to the resource. The number of sequences in UniProtKB has risen to approximately 190 million, despite continued work to reduce sequence redundancy at the proteome level. We have adopted new methods of assessing proteome completeness and quality. We continue to extract detailed annotations from the literature to add to reviewed entries and supplement these in unreviewed entries with annotations provided by automated systems such as the newly implemented Association-Rule-Based Annotator (ARBA). We have developed a credit-based publication submission interface to allow the community to contribute publications and annotations to UniProt entries. We describe how UniProtKB responded to the COVID-19 pandemic through expert curation of relevant entries that were rapidly made available to the research community through a dedicated portal.

  abstract = {Abstract                            Motivation               One avenue to address the paucity of clinically testable targets is to reinvestigate the druggable genome by tackling complicated types of targets such as Protein-Protein Interactions (PPIs). Given the challenge to target those interfaces with small chemical compounds, it has become clear that learning from successful examples of PPI modulation is a powerful strategy. Freely accessible databases of PPI modulators that provide the community with tractable chemical and pharmacological data, as well as powerful tools to query them, are therefore essential to stimulate new drug discovery projects on PPI targets.                                         Results               Here, we present the new version iPPI-DB, our manually curated database of PPI modulators. In this completely redesigned version of the database, we introduce a new web interface relying on crowdsourcing for the maintenance of the database. This interface was created to enable community contributions, whereby external experts can suggest new database entries. Moreover, the data model, the graphical interface, and the tools to query the database have been completely modernized and improved. We added new PPI modulators, new PPI targets and extended our focus to stabilizers of PPIs as well.                                         Availability and implementation               The iPPI-DB server is available at https://ippidb.pasteur.fr The source code for this server is available at https://gitlab.pasteur.fr/ippidb/ippidb-web/ and is distributed under GPL licence (http://www.gnu.org/licences/gpl). Queries can be shared through persistent links according to the FAIR data standards. Data can be downloaded from the website as csv files.

  abstract = {Virtual screening has long since become an integral part of the drug discovery process in both industry and academia. Its main purpose is to reduce huge compound databases to a manageable number of promising drug candidates with the help of computational methods. In order to provide reliable predictions, screening campaigns always aim to incorporate as much knowledge as possible about the target protein and its known binding partners. For that reason, the resulting workflows generally comprise multiple consecutive stages in which the different types of information are processed. The multitude of available methodologies and the strong dependency of the results on each individual step make virtual screening a complex task with numerous pitfalls which is usually only performed by specialized computational chemists. The aim of the presented work was to provide a reliable basis for the development of software applications supporting the inclusion of medicinal chemists in computer-aided drug design activities. The result of this effort is a new cheminformatics framework (NAOMI) for virtual screening which has been specifically designed to meet the demanding requirements imposed by this scenario. First, based on both innovative and intuitively understandable concepts, NAOMI enables medicinal chemists to contribute their expert knowledge and experience at those points of the calculations that are crucial for the success of their current projects. Second, building on the consistent internal chemical model NAOMI comprises numerous novel cheminformatics methods enabling an efficient execution of each individual step of the virtual screening workflow. Apart from being a crucial factor in high-throughput calculations, computational speed is also of the essence in interactive applications which, in combination with intuitive user interfaces, are a key factor in involving medicinal chemists in computational endeavors. Third, great care was taken to ensure that the results of each stage are chemically reasonable and that a high degree of consistency is maintained between the different components of the pipeline. This is important as many steps of the process have to be automated in order to allow medicinal chemists to focus on those aspects relevant for their projects. As is shown in the publications presented in this work, many individual methods included in the NAOMI framework are in themselves relevant contributions to their specific field of application and their combination results in efficient, completely automated, and highly adaptable screening workflows.},

  abstract = {Sepsis is a frequently fatal condition characterized by an uncontrolled and harmful host reaction to microbial infection. Despite the prevalence and severity of sepsis, we lack a fundamental grasp of its pathophysiology. Here we report that the cytokine interleukin (IL)-3 potentiates inflammation in sepsis. Using a mouse model of abdominal sepsis, we show that innate response activator (IRA) B cells produce IL-3, which induces myelopoiesis of Ly-6Chigh monocytes and neutrophils, and fuels a cytokine storm. IL-3 deficiency protects mice against sepsis. In humans with sepsis, high plasma IL-3 levels associate with high mortality even after adjusting for prognostic indicators. Altogether, this study deepens our understanding of immune activation, identifies IL-3 as an orchestrator of emergency myelopoiesis, and reveals a new therapeutic target for treating sepsis.},
